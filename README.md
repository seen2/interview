  # Comparison of Algorithmic Techniques

| **Technique**          | **Use Case**                                      | **Example Problems**                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Sliding Window**      | Subarrays or substrings with a condition         | Longest substring without repeating characters |
| **Frequency Counting**  | Count occurrences of elements                    | Anagrams, frequency of elements               |
| **Two-Pointer**         | Searching for pairs or comparisons in sorted arrays | Sum of two numbers in a sorted array          |
| **Binary Search**       | Searching in a sorted collection                 | Finding an element in a sorted array           |
| **Greedy Algorithm**    | Locally optimal choices leading to a global solution | Activity selection, coin change problem       |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Overlapping subproblems with optimal substructure | Fibonacci, knapsack problem                   |
| **Backtracking**        | Exploration of all possibilities (combinations, permutations) | N-Queens, Sudoku solving                     |
| **Divide and Conquer**  | Divide a problem into smaller subproblems        | Merge Sort, Quick Sort                        |
| **Union-Find**          | Managing disjoint sets, connected components     | Finding connected components in a graph       |
| **Topological Sort**    | Ordering tasks with dependencies                 | Task scheduling, course prerequisites         |
